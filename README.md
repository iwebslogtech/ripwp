<h1>First Things First</h1>
<p>Welcome. RipWP is a very special project to me. RipWP is a collection of some 
of the best plugins and themes from the open source world of WordPress and other 
applications. It makes it easy to install and run your website or blog in few 
minutes. We&#8217;re dedicated to making it better every day. Thank you for making it 
a part of your world.</p>

<h1>Installation: Famous 5-minute install</h1>
<ol>
	<li>Unzip the package in an empty directory and upload everything.</li>
	<li>Open <span class="file"><a href="wp-admin/install.php">wp-admin/install.php</a></span> in your browser. It will take you through the process to set up a <code>wp-config.php</code> file with your database connection details.
		<ol>
			<li>If for some reason this doesn&#8217;t work, don&#8217;t worry. It doesn&#8217;t work on all web hosts. Open up <code>wp-config-sample.php</code> with a text editor like WordPad or similar and fill in your database connection details.</li>
			<li>Save the file as <code>wp-config.php</code> and upload it.</li>
			<li>Open <span class="file"><a href="wp-admin/install.php">wp-admin/install.php</a></span> in your browser.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Once the configuration file is set up, the installer will set up the tables needed for your blog. If there is an error, double check your <code>wp-config.php</code> file, and try again. If it fails again, please go to the
    <a title="WordPress support" href="http://www.ripwp.com/support/">support forums</a> with as much data as you can gather.</li>
	<li><strong>If you did not enter a password, note the password given to you.</strong> If you did not provide a username, it will be <code>admin</code>.</li>
	<li>The installer should then send you to the <a href="wp-login.php">login page</a>. Sign in with the username and password you chose during the installation. If a password was generated for you, you can then click on &#8220;Profile&#8221; to change the password.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Updating</h1>
<h2>Using the Automatic Updater</h2>
<p>If you are updating from version 2.7 or higher, you can use the automatic updater:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Open <span class="file"><a href="wp-admin/update-core.php">wp-admin/update-core.php</a></span> in your browser and follow the instructions.</li>
	<li>You wanted more, perhaps? That&#8217;s it!</li>
</ol>

<h2>Updating Manually</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Before you update anything, make sure you have backup copies of any files you may have modified such as <code>index.php</code>.</li>
	<li>Delete your old RipWP files, saving ones you&#8217;ve modified.</li>
	<li>Upload the new files.</li>
	<li>Point your browser to <span class="file"><a href="wp-admin/upgrade.php">/wp-admin/upgrade.php</a>.</span></li>
</ol>
